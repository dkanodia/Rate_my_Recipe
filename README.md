## Introduction

Food plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, influencing our health, culture, and emotions. Cooking, for many, is not only a necessity but a fulfilling hobby that brings creativity and joy to the kitchen. However, as much as we enjoy flavorful meals, we also need to consider the nutritional impact of the food we consume. With the rising concerns about health and diet, understanding how specific ingredients or nutrients affect our food preferences has become more important than ever. This is particularly true for recipes that vary in their nutritional content, such as sugar, fat, and protein.

The first dataset, `recipe`, contains 83782 rows, indicating 83782 unique recipes, with 10 columns recording the following information:

The second dataset, `interactions`, contains 731927 rows and each row contains a review from the user on a specific recipe. The columns it includes are:

| Column        | Description         |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| `'user_id'`   | User ID             |
| `'recipe_id'` | Recipe ID           |
| `'date'`      | Date of interaction |
| `'rating'`    | Rating given        |
| `'review'`    | Review text         |

In this project, I am investigating how recipe characteristics such as nutritional content, preparation time, and ingredient count influence a recipe’s average rating. My central question is: What factors most significantly influence a recipe's average rating? This question is important as it provides insights into the preferences of users on recipe platforms and could help food creators, nutritionists, and chefs design recipes that meet popular demand.
